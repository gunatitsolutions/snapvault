<h1>SnapVault Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>SnapVault values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our app.</p>

<p>By using SnapVault, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or uploaded content on our servers.
    All user-generated content and files remain stored locally on your device.</p>

<p>However, SnapVault uses Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics for performance monitoring and app improvement. These services may automatically collect limited technical data, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Crash logs (non-personal)</li>
    <li>Usage patterns and session durations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> While this information does not directly identify you, it may be classified as personal data under certain privacy laws (such as GDPR or CCPA). SnapVault uses this data solely for improving app stability and functionality and does not use it to personally identify users.</p>

<h2>2. How Your Data is Used</h2>
<p>We use the information collected via Firebase services to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor and improve app performance</li>
    <li>Diagnose and fix bugs or crashes</li>
    <li>Enhance the overall user experience</li>
    <li>Improve features based on general usage trends</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Collect user-uploaded personal files or identifiable personal data</li>
    <li>Sell, rent, or share collected data with third parties</li>
    <li>Store your personal content on external servers (other than anonymized analytics and crash logs through Firebase)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Core Features and Local Data Handling</h2>
<p>SnapVaultâ€™s main features operate fully offline, with your data saved directly on your device:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Image Quote Creator:</strong> Customize images with quotes; files are stored locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Video to Audio Converter:</strong> Upload and convert videos; audio output is stored locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Festival Post Generator:</strong> Create and save festival posts with business details; saved only on your device.</li>
</ul>

<p>You maintain full control over what you save, share, or delete.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>SnapVault integrates only with Googleâ€™s Firebase platform for crash reporting and analytics purposes. We do not integrate with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising networks</li>
    <li>External APIs (other than Firebase)</li>
    <li>Cloud databases or external file storage services</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable measures to help secure the data stored on your device. However, as storage remains on your personal device, we recommend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using device-level protections (e.g., screen lock, biometric security)</li>
    <li>Managing who has physical access to your device and stored files</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>SnapVault is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or process any personal data from children. The app is designed for general audiences aged 13 and older.</p>

<h2>7. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or services. Any updates will be posted here, with a revised 29 April 2025 date. We encourage users to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
